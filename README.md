This is a full-stack hotel booking application built with Next.js and Firebase with following functionality and key concepts:

We can;

- Browse available hotel rooms and view detailed specifications and pricing,

- Login securely using a Google Account (via NextAuth.js) to access booking features,

- Create real-time reservations that are instantly saved to the Firestore database,

- Manage bookings by viewing or deleting existing reservations from a personalized dashboard,

In this project; Next.js architecture, Firebase Firestore (NoSQL), Complex Security Rules, NextAuth.js authentication flow, Tailwind CSS styling, and Vercel deployment were practiced.

Integrated Contentful Headless CMS to dynamically drive the 'About' page content.
